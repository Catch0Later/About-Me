						<p>My name is Sabrina Seerattan, I am currently an intern at Equifax. I am originally from Toronto Canada, I migrated here during highshool. I would like to say I enjoy atlanta weather, but I dont personally I miss the snow. My hobbies range from learning code, computer animation, building animatronics and stopmotion characters, drawing, painting, and sculpting, and digital design. My goals are to learn new programming languages, and work for the FBI as a Cyber Security Analyst or Ethical Hacker.</p>
